You'll learn useful tricks, like how to write context managers and decorators. You'll also learn best practices around how to write maintainable reusable functions with good documentation.

So far, you have written two decorators that will add bold or italics tags to any function that returns a string. You notice, however, that these two decorators look very similar. Instead of writing a bunch of other similar looking decorators, you want to create one decorator, html(), that can take any pair of opening and closing tags.\n","\n","def bold(func):\n","  @wraps(func)\n","  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n","    msg = func(*args, **kwargs)\n","    return '<b>{}</b>'.format(msg)\n","  return wrapper\n","def italics(func):\n","  @wraps(func)\n","  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n","    msg = func(*args, **kwargs)\n","    return '<i>{}</i>'.format(msg)\n","  return wrapper\n","## Instructions 1/4\n","\n","Return the decorator and the decorated function from the correct places in the new html() decorator.\n","\n","## 2/4\n","Use the html() decorator to wrap the return value of hello() in the strings <b> and </b> (the HTML tags that mean \"bold\").\n","\n","## 3/4\n","Use html() to wrap the return value of goodbye() in the strings <i> and </i> (the HTML tags that mean \"italics\").\n","\n","## 4/4\n","Use html() to wrap hello_goodbye() in a DIV, which is done by adding the strings <div> and </div> tags around a string."],"metadata":{"id":"AVb_VoqAufXu"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def html(open_tag, close_tag):\n","  def decorator(func):\n","    @wraps(func)\n","    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n","      msg = func(*args, **kwargs)\n","      return '{}{}{}'.format(open_tag, msg, close_tag)\n","    # Return the decorated function\n","    return wrapper\n","  # Return the decorator\n","  return decorator"],"metadata":{"id":"ppBSII-kwCzW"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Make hello() return bolded text\n","@html('<b>', '</b>')\n","def hello(name):\n","  return 'Hello {}!'.format(name)\n","\n","print(hello('Alice'))"],"metadata":{"id":"6JKeRKrbwJR4"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["<script.py> output:\n","    <b>Hello Alice!</b>"],"metadata":{"id":"1M6yC2ErylAF"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Make goodbye() return italicized text\n","@html('<i>', '</i>')\n","def goodbye(name):\n","  return 'Goodbye {}.'.format(name)\n","\n","print(goodbye('Alice'))"],"metadata":{"id":"qoU85Pl0yo3a"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["<script.py> output:\n","    <i>Goodbye Alice.</i>"],"metadata":{"id":"_s-VhEWiytQM"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Wrap the result of hello_goodbye() in <div> and </div>\n","@html('<div>', '</div>')\n","def hello_goodbye(name):\n","  return '\\n{}\\n{}\\n'.format(hello(name), goodbye(name))\n","\n","print(hello_goodbye('Alice'))"],"metadata":{"id":"h87xtLDVywXL"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["<script.py> output:\n","    <i>Goodbye Alice.</i>\n","\n","<script.py> output:\n","    <div>\n","    <b>Hello Alice!</b>\n","    <i>Goodbye Alice.</i>\n","    </div>"],"metadata":{"id":"HRPd5EOQyz6b"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["That's some HTML hotness!
