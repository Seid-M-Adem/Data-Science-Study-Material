Or perhaps you have a set of texts, such as Wikipedia pages, and you wish to segment them into categories based on their content. This is the world of unsupervised learning, called as such because you are not guiding, or supervising, the pattern discovery by some prediction task, but instead uncovering hidden structure from unlabeled data. Unsupervised learning encompasses a variety of techniques in machine learning, from clustering to dimension reduction to matrix factorization. In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of unsupervised learning and implement the essential algorithms using scikit-learn and SciPy. You will learn how to cluster, transform, visualize, and extract insights from unlabeled datasets, and end the course by building a recommender system to recommend popular musical artists.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"jIp0mRk1Y2dQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Chapter 1 Clustering for Dataset Exploration\n","\n","Learn how to discover the underlying groups (or \"clusters\") in a dataset.
